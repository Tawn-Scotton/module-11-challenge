# module-11-challenge
Webscraping using splinter, pandas libraries Beautiful Soup, and matplotlib.  I used these tools to analyse the Mars Temperature Data Site (https://statis.bc.edc.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.htlm"

Deliverable 1:


Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
Using Beautiful Soup and splinter.

Then we viewed the Mars news site to scrape the data.
I scraped the Mars News site using Beautiful Soup (html parser), extracted all the text elements and stored them. 

Deliverable 2:
By opening the webpage, I used Chrome DevTools to find usable classes.
Step 2,(Web Scraping) I used a Beautiful Soup parser. Then extracted raw data.
Step 3(Store the Data) I turned the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Step 4(Prep Data for Analysis) I casted (coverted some of the datatypes) by using dtypes, I found that all the data was initally objects but to use the numerical data, it had to be casted (astype, and to_datetime) to be useful in our challenge.
Step 5(Analyze the Data) Using Pandas function, I answered 5 questions about the information from the webpage. 
Step 6(saved the data)

Quit the browser.
